# MERN-
This repository has my files and tasks for the ethnus MERN course. The course teaches HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. Each task tests my skills in these technologies. The tasks are in folders by topics. You can see the live demo of each task in the README file. I hope this repository helps you.
